            <div class="description"> Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the
                subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s why it’s often best to put the topic sentence at the
                very beginning of the paragraph

            <div class="description"> A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all
                related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences
                should be organized into paragraphs.
